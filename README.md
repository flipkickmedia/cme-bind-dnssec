# cme-bind-dnssec

## Overview

Some scripts to manage DNSSEC on BIND v9.18.1 to work with DNSSEC DS/CDS keys.

## Description

To keep DNS secure https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8078 provides a means for a child DNS server to be able to automatically update the parent with keys, when a CDS/CDNSKEY record changes.

These scripts monitor the bind logs for CDS and KSK publishing and updates the DS records accordingly.

## Installation
To use, extract the files to somewhere safe on your DNS server, `/usr/local/sbin` is a good place

```
git clone ssh://git.flipkick.media/cme/cme-bind-dnssec /usr/local/sbin/cme-bind-dnssec
cp /usr/local/sbin/cme-bind-dnssec/bind-dnssec-monitor.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl enable bind-dnssec-monitor.service
systemctl start bind-dnssec-monitor.service
systemctl restart named
```

If you do a
```
ps -ef | grep bash
```
You should see
```

```


, and run `monitor.sh` script before starting named.
